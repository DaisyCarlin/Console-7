Rules:
- Do not claim certainty.
- Use cautious language.
- Do not give a generic answer like "it is classified" or "it is national security-related."
- Explain the likely operational reason it is sensitive, such as reconnaissance, ISR, military communications, missile warning, government monitoring, or strategic support.
